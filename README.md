# MultiItemLotSizingShipmentMinimization

This repository contains supplementary documentation for the paper 'Uncapacitated multi-item lot sizing  with shipment minimization', published in Computers and Operations Research, by Marcel Turkensteen and Wilco van den Heuvel.

This repository contains instances used in the experiments in Sections 5.1 to 5.4 of the paper. The instances in this repository are related to the sections in the paper as follows:
- DataCoolBlueNew: Section 5.1.
- DataBoctor, DataRobinson07, DataRobinson09: Sections 5.2 and 5.3.
- DataSynthetic: Section 5.4.

The source codes for solving these instances, both using Cplex and using the introduced (Bilevel) Dynamic Programming heuristics can be obtained from the authors on request. Likewise, the solutions and an instance generator written in R for generating the CB instances can be  obtained from the authors on request as well.
